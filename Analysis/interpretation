Gett Failed Orders Analysis - Documentation
Project Overview
Objective: Investigate why certain Gett orders failed by analyzing timestamps, cancellations, ETA, and spatial patterns.
Data Sources:
- data_orders.csv: Order-specific metadata including cancellation reasons, timestamps, coordinates, ETA, and driver assignment status.
- data_offers.csv: Mapping of offers sent to drivers for each order.
Key Tasks & Interpretations

1. Distribution of Orders by Failure Reason
Orders were classified into three main categories based on status codes:
- Cancelled before driver assigned
- Cancelled after driver assigned
- Rejected by system
A bar chart was created showing that "Cancelled before driver assigned" was the most frequent reason. This indicates that users often cancel before a match is found, likely due to long ETAs or app response delays.
Insight: Improving perceived wait time and app feedback could reduce premature cancellations.
2. Failed Orders by Hour and Reason
Orders were grouped by the hour of day and analyzed based on failure reason. A stacked histogram revealed:
- Rejections spike during early morning and late evening.
- Cancellations before assignment peak during off-peak hours.
Interpretation: These trends could reflect driver shortages or system strain during specific hours.
3. Time to Cancellation by Driver Assignment and Hour
Using cancellation time (in seconds), the average time before canceling was plotted:
- Users wait longer to cancel if a driver was assigned.
- Sharp peaks were visible at morning and late-night hours.
Conclusion: Assignment increases user patience. High wait times despite driver assignment could reflect geographic or traffic inefficiencies.
4. Distribution of ETA by Hour
Boxplots were created showing the distribution of ETA (estimated time of arrival) by hour of day.
- ETAs are higher in early mornings and late evenings.
- Greater ETA variance occurs during peak traffic hours.
Interpretation: ETAs affect user behavior directly. Interventions to optimize route efficiency or ETA accuracy could help reduce cancellations.
5. Bonus: H3 Hexagon Map of Failed Orders
Using H3 spatial indexing (resolution 8), failed orders were clustered into hexagonal bins and plotted using Folium.
- The top hexes that contain 80% of failed orders were identified.
- These were mapped by frequency using red marker intensities.
Conclusion: A small number of geographic areas account for the majority of failed orders.
Final Summary
This analysis highlights multiple levers that can reduce ride failure rates at Gett:
- Enhance app responsiveness and early feedback
- Predict high-failure time windows and adjust supply
- Address high-failure geographic hotspots
- Improve ETA estimation and reduce uncertainty
Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- H3, Folium for geospatial mapping
- Google Colab for interactive analysis
